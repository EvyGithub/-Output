# -Output
Ok it's technically a +Output interpreter, but whatever.

-Output is another language btw.

Since -Output requires the codebox to be shown, I made the +Output interpreter only. (And I'm too lazy to make -Output even though it's pretty easy)

Check out [-Output on the esolangs.org wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/-Output) and [+Output](https://esolangs.org/wiki/%2BOutput) for information on these two esolangs.
